# UnityDemo
This project is a rough test of a few of Unity's properities.

Currently this project looks at Unities ability to:

- move a player and camera

- generate objects dynamically

- switch scenes

I plan to add onto this project as I learn more about Unity and its capabilites. I am currently working on getting C# to call a phython script. Some preliminary code for this is commented out in the CreateCubes script under Assets/Scripts.
