# UnityDemo
This project is a test/documenation of the Unity features we will need for our project.

Currently this project looks at Unities ability to:

- move a player and camera

- generate objects dynamically

- switch scenes

- Create text that is blocked by other objects.

- connect to Reddit with RedditSharp (Currently in progress. To access this features use the menu item RedditSharp.)

This demo will be updated as we figure out how Unity/Our Server/Reddit API work.

Know Issues/Things to work on:

- Player falls through floor when rapidly switching scenes.

- RedditSharp does not work with Oath2.
