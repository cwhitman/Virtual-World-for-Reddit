# Reddit Features and Implementation
  This document lists out every feature that Reddit offers and how we plan to implement that feature.
It is currently a work in progress. Nothing here is set in stone. 
As we come up with new ideas or decide against old ideas, this document will be updated.

This document is organized by Reddit Features. The four main Reddit features subreddits, threads, comments, and users are listed.
Each of these different features has a layout section, an attribute section, and an ability to section.
The layout section lists out how our 3D implementation will be layouted. 
The attribute section lists out the properties of that Reddit section. 
The ability to section lists out the actions that can be performed on these sections (like organize comments by new or add a new comment).
The basic format is Reddit Feature:Our Implementation. 

##Overall Layout

  - A city consisting of buildings and neighborhoods.
  
  - User will be able to either walk or teleport around the city (a map may be used as the teleporation device)
  
  - Neighborhoods will probably only be loaded one at a time (this is due to a restriction in how fast we can get information from Reddit)
