#Use Case: 3, User Navigates World and Views Reddit Content

###Characteristic Information

**Primary Actor:** Reddit Guest

**Goal:** Actor will be able to travel around our world, navigate to the Reddit content they desire, and view that content.

**Scope:** User Interface

**Level:** User Goal

**Trigger:** User opens our application

**Success End Condition:** User navigates world, views content, and exits

**Failed End Condition:** User is told that content unavailable and application either exits or loads default structure

###Stakeholders/Interests

 * Reddit guests: Navigate and view content in the virtual world

 * Server: Receive correct requests for data and send it back to the user

 * Reddit: Requires its data to be appropriately used and represented, and to give user appropriate warnings when they attempt to access certain functions when not logged in

###Preconditions

 * Application is loaded

 * Server is currently running

 * User is connected to the Internet and has a system with correct capabilities (i.e. windows, android)

###Minimal Gaurantee

 * The program will open and provide a correct error message

 * The program will handle errors from the server

###Main Success Scenario

1. User appears in the main page of the virtual world (their home)

2. User successfully navigates to desired content (subreddit, thread, comment)

 a) Using map:  User presses button to bring up map of subreddits organized into sections by types (i.e. NSFW area).  The user will be able to zoom in and out on certain areas and scroll around on the map, then select the subreddit they want to navigate to.  The map will also have a search bar functionality.
 
 b) Using teleportation device:  User will enter the device and be able to scroll through and select a saved location.  The device will also have the same search bar as the map.

3. User views content

 a) If the user attempts to interact with content, the program will prompt the user to login or create an account through a text box      overlayed on the screen

4. User downloads content to their deviceâ€™s library (images, gifs, videos, etc.)

###Extensions

 * 1: All content is unavailable (server down, server not responding, Reddit down etc.)
 
   + 1: Give error message
   
   + 2: Quit application (is this appropriate, or should we let the user exit on their own?)

 * 2: A particular piece of content cannot be loaded (server down, subreddit private, Reddit down etc.)
 
   + 1: Tell user that the content is unavailable
 
   + 2: In background, continuously attempt to get content
 
   + 3: Load default structure in place of content

 * 3a: Reddit unavailable
 
   + 1: Tell user they are unable to login
   
 * 3a: Unable to login
 
   + 1: Respond with error message
