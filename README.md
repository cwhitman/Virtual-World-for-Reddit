Project Name: To be determined...

Project Description:
  We aim to create an assitive search technology for people with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  The project will be a web-based program which aids people with TBI in searching effectively using existing search engines.  The web program will learn user's search stragtegies and help the user find what they need.  It will differ from other search engines by allowing a user to enter their entire goal. Our search engine will then either reconstruct their search into a more effective sentence, or provide the user with a set of searches to reach their goal.  The web application will provide users a way to save their results in a more easily read manner.
