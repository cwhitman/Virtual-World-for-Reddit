Project Name: 3D World for Reddit

Project Description:

  We aim to create a 3D world based off of Reddit.  This world will be a city type structure consisting of neighborhoods, buildings, elevators, rooms, and stick figure people. Inside this world one will be able to navigate Reddit threads, read Reddit comments, and post new content. Each component of this world is described in more detail below.


Buildings:


    •	Represents a subreddit.
    
    •	Size will change depending on how many subscribers in that subreddit. 
    
    •	Upkeep of the building will be based on how old the subreddit is and how active it is.
        o	Older/less active subreddits will appear more decrepit. 

Neighborhoods: 


    •	Represents the genre of content.
        o	Financial, DIY, Politics, AMA etc.
        
    •	Building styles within the neighborhood will be based on the genre.
    
        o	For example, all financial related subreddits will be banks.
        
    •	We will have a default building style for anything that does not fit into one of our predefined genres.

Elevators: 


    • Allows use to select new pages in a subreddit and choose if we want the threads to be sorted by hot, new, controversial, rising, or gilded.

Rooms: 


    •	In the front of the room will be the top commenters. Shaking their hand will cause them to bring you over to their comment thread.       You can then interact with all of the people in this comment thread.
    
    •	People will be grouped by the comment they reply to. 
    
    •	Gallery type style to display images.
    
        o	A stick figure could be displaying their image/content.

Stick Figures: 


    •	There will be one stick figure for each comment.
    
    •	Gender neutral
    
    •	Possibility to customize 
    
        o	For example, can add triangle or square clothing.
        
    •	Interacting with them will cause them to say the comment they represent.
